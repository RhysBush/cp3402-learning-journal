<h1>Week 01 Learning Journal - Rhys Bush</h1>

<h2>Learning Activities and Resources</h2>
<p>This week I modified a bootstrap template "Product" to create a website. To do this, I studied LinkedIn Learning's "Introduction to Web Design and Development" course to reaffirm my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript - all three languages will be useful for up-incoming practicals and assignments. I also watched a YouTube tutorial on downloading and modifying a bootstrap example - this may be of use in future practicals.</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>Approximately 4 hours.</p>

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>Bootstrap enables developers to create websites for a client without creating new HTML, CSS, and Javascript documents for each project.
Static website hosting (I used Github Pages) allows for basic websites to be publicly shared and tested without the need for each developer to have an individual copy of each file.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is used by developers to reduce the time needed to create a website mockup for a client.
I learnt advanced CSS and Javascript that I did not learn in CP1404, which will enable me to understand and modify other's code more efficiently.
From my experiences this week, watching the pre-lectures/recommended learning resources and attempting the practical work before I attend the in-person classes will enable me to ask questions to team members and provide more time to submit my practical work.</p>
